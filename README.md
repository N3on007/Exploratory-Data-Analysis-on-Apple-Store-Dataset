# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Apple-Store-Dataset
Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Apple Store Apps data using SQL. The analysis includes various SQL queries to gain insights into the dataset, such as checking missing values, exploring the distribution of app genres, reviewing app ratings, and more.

Key Insights

The following key insights have been derived from the exploratory data analysis:

Paid vs Free Apps: Paid apps tend to have higher ratings than free apps

Ratings Based on Supported Languages: Apps supporting 10-30 languages achieve higher ratings compared to those with fewer or more supported 

Genres with Low Ratings: Finance and book apps exhibit lower average ratings

Description Length and User Ratings Correlation: Apps with longer descriptions generally receive better ratings

Optimal Average Rating: Aspiring developers should aim for an average rating above 3.5

Competition in Games and Entertainment Genres: Games and entertainment genres face high competition in the app market.
